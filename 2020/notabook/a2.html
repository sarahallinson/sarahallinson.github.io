        There’s more TV than ever—but series are being given fewer and fewer episodes. That’s an awful precedent, argues Schur: “What if The Sopranos was 30 episodes? Shit, that would be terrible.”

      <p class="child bdr-start">
        Given the state of the world, most scripted shows are unlikely to begin production on new episodes any time soon. But well before the coronavirus hit, the TV industry was going through its latest round of seismic changes—this time driven by the streaming wars and game-changing subscription models. All those changes are likely to accelerate when Hollywood returns to whatever “normal” is, later this year or next year.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-middle">
        For <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/06/is-tv-sabotaging-itself">a recent column about how TV runs are shrinking</a>—and why that’s something to be wary of if you love TV—I spoke to Michael Schur, who knows a little something about quality television. Schur is a veteran of <i>The Office</i> and <i>Saturday Night Live</i> who, among other credits, was the showrunner for <i>Parks and Recreation</i> and the creator of the beloved philosophical comedy <i>The Good Place</i>, which aired its series finale in the Before Times (i.e. January of this accursed year).

      <p class="child bdr-end">
        Schur and I agreed that shorter overall runs—for his show, for <i>Fleabag</i>, for any number of other concise, distilled stories—can indeed be a great thing. But he also laid out in detail the economic forces that are currently pushing the industry to favor short seasons—and fewer seasons—to an unsettling and possibly inadvisable degree. This is an edited version of our conversation.
      </p>

      <p class="child bdr-full">
        Vanity Fair: 
I am the first to admit that short runs can be better. But now it seems TV is being forced in the other direction. That brings me to <i>The Shield</i>, which ran for 88 episodes and was incredible because of what they’d done during the entire run of seven seasons. How do you get to that kind of moving, deep last season in this environment?
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-start p2">
        Michael Schur: 
You don’t. What you’re describing is the single biggest issue facing the future of television production. Your incentive to make the best show you can runs into the brick wall of a complete lack of interest in keeping your show around. And not even at the point where it becomes prohibitively expensive—just more expensive than it was before.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-middle p2">
        Let’s start with the good aspects of the new world that we’re in. Number one, and probably most important, a lot of historically marginalized and underrepresented voices are now being heard. The second sort of basket of positivity involves what we did with <i>The Good Place</i>—you can say, “This idea is about 53 episodes long.” And for the first time, because of this new world of immediate aftermarket sales, studios can make money off of a 53-episode show. They can be in profit right away, or it’s an at least break-even proposition.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-end p2">
        Those two things are massive improvements over the old system. However, it comes at an incredible cost.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-full">
        And one of the biggest costs is, what if you have an idea that could easily go for 80 or 200 episodes? But 30 or 40 episodes is what a lot of creators are looking at—if they’re lucky.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-full p2">
        Exactly. In the old system, you might have a contentious relationship with your studio. You might have a tricky relationship with your network. You might fight and yell and scream all the time about the creative direction of the show or who to cast in it or whatever. But in theory, everyone had the same goal, which was to make the show, have it be successful and last as long as it could. Because that’s how everybody made money, right? The system might not have been perfect, but the end goal of television production was the same for creator and studios. Everybody was rowing in the same direction.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-full">
        And that direction is not the same now.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-start p2">
        Correct. Now you have Netflix, and Apple, and places like Hulu, Disney+, Peacock, HBO Max, and so forth. Their business model has completely inverted that system.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-middle p2">
        What has come to be more and more popular is what they call the Cost Plus model. [Under that model] points in the show are worth something immediately. That was sold as this huge benefit, because, as we all know, most TV shows fail. Your points in the show are often worthless because shows often fail, and the shows are always in deficit because of the fancy accounting that studios and networks do. But with Cost Plus, you’re immediately making extra money [that could represent ever-larger sums in seasons three, four and five].
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-middle p2">
        The problem, of course, is that they can just kill your show. It doesn’t matter what you would have done in season five. It doesn’t matter what they promise you. They’re never intending to go there. It is one of the great fast ones that has ever been pulled on the creative community.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-end p2">
        This is all mathematics, and soon they get to a point where they have three seasons of your show, and that’s enough. There are shows that are massive, like <i>Stranger Things</i>. But other than that, they have shows that you would consider successes by any stretch of the imagination, in terms of the people who watch and the awards that they get—and they will slit your throat. Any of these places will slit your throat without thinking twice before the show can get to the point where they really have to pay the people who own parts of the show.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-full">
        It’s such a radical shift from how things used to be.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-start p2">
        Well, here’s how it was explained to me by someone who shall remain nameless, but it’s a powerful person in Hollywood. Let’s say this person’s name is Jim. Jim told me, what these places do is, they use shows as radar signals. They make all sorts of weird shit, and they send it out into the world.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-end p2">
        They get a signal back, and the signal is, “Hey, a million people spread over the country are really interested in a show—this workplace comedy about, let’s say, lesbian viola makers.” That show never would have in a million years been able to air on CBS or ABC or whatever. It gets to exist for a little while. But then what happens is, before that show can get too expensive for them, they kill it and they develop something else that’s cheaper that they think will grab those same people.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-full">
        And there’s not much recourse for the audience or the creator. Because we’re on the way to every company functioning as its own closed ecosystem—the studio and network or platform are all in one place. And that has far-reaching implications.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-start p2">
        We’re being siloed off from the outside. These companies are changing their business models and making it essentially impossible for an outside studio to produce a show for them. They’re doing it intentionally.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-end p2">
        Take this new world of killing shows before they can last a long time, then combine that with the fact that you don’t have a choice of where your show ends up, unless you’re completely a free agent. A lot of people don’t have a studio fighting for them. The people at the studio are part of the same company that owns the streamer—they have to abide by what people above them in the food chain want. There’s no argument. There’s no debate.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-full">
        So you end up with a model that favors short runs. But I would argue many of the finest TV shows of all time are ones that generally went longer than 20 or even 40 episodes.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-start p2">
        Oh, of course. I look at the shows my kids are obsessed with—they’re all shows that had 125 to 200 episodes. Let’s say 30 episodes is the new 100 episodes. Jim kissed Pam in episode 28 of <i>The Office</i>, right? Imagine that being the end of the story—not the beginning. It’s horrifying to think about.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p class="child bdr-full">
        Now I’m going to have nightmares about that. Thanks.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-full p2">
        Yeah, well, that’s the thing—everyone, including me for a while, went googly-eyed about the idea that you didn’t have to make your show that long. That was a revelation. What none of us thought about was, you won’t be <i>able</i> to go long. I do fear, I think with good reason, that means that something essential about what television is going to be lost.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-full">
        Absolutely. My contention is not that every show should go long—but it should be an option on the table.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-start p2">
        Right. If you could design the system the way you wanted it, I don’t think you would remove the concept of the 100-episode run. As evidenced by the fact that a bunch of 11- and 12-year-olds are currently obsessed with <i>The Office</i> and <i>Friends</i> and shows like that.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-end p2">
        The effect on the viewer is bad. The effect on the creative community is just as bad, if not worse. If you now want to create a show that has that feeling and that goal, you can’t do it—and that’s not good. We’ve basically traded one thing [that] was impossible, which was the shorter run, and instead, we’ve made longer runs impossible.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-full">
        Some shows find their greatness over time, or just need a decent amount of real estate to tell a good or great story.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-start p2">
        It bums me out, because the advantage television has always had over movies is exactly that. You could sit in a world for a decade, and you could take people from 20-year-old ding-dongs who had no path through life, and take them to being married, if they chose to get married, or having kids, or advancing their careers or finding themselves or whatever.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-middle p2">
        You could sit with Tony Soprano for eight seasons. You could feel yourself being drawn into his complicated psychology. What if <i>The Sopranos</i> was 30 episodes? Shit, that would be terrible.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-end p2">
        You know, television is an art form. It was an art form that allowed that possibility of telling a long story of the ups and downs of characters’ lives. And if that is removed as a weapon for people who create television, then the medium itself is being robbed.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-start">
        I just rewatched <i>Lost</i>, and so many good or great episodes came past the midpoint of the run—“The Constant” is the 77th episode. “LaFleur” is not a famous episode, but it’s one of my favorites, and it’s way after that.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p class="child bdr-start p2">
        “The Constant” is one of the greatest hours of television I’ve ever seen. It was a singular hour of television that made you feel so many things, and it was so inventive and so cool. You don’t get to do an episode like that unless you've been building these little weird Lego toys on your Lego table for a long time.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-middle p2">
        Those episodes, they’re just a singular creative enterprise that is unachievable by any other show. No other show but The Sopranos could have done “Pine Barrens,” and no other show but <i>Lost</i> could have done “The Constant.” You just don’t get those kinds of episodes unless the show is this rich soup of stuff that has been simmering for years. There’s a kind of episode you can only do if a show’s been around for a long time. And I just fear that’s going to go away.
      </p>
      <div class="child bdr-end p2">
        <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f7vBbEG0zH0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </div>
      <p class="child bdr-full">
        And so now we have a lot of companies thinking people will want to pay a monthly subscription for a bunch of shows that last for 20 or 40 episodes—at the most.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-start p2">
        That’s the bet they’re making, right? They had a bunch of very slow-burning logs, and the bet that they’re making is that they can keep the fire burning with kindling.
      </p>
      <p class="child bdr-end p2">
        I don’t know if they’re right. They may be. But it appears that their belief is that the money that they can make from subscriptions is acceptable only if they have a lot of new shows that are popping up every year. I don’t know that they’re wrong. They’re pretty smart people and they have a lot of computers, and they seem to have a bead on this. We’ll see.
