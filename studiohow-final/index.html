					"The Trash Kraken Rises"
				</h1>
				<h2>
					Game Concept
				</h2>
				<p>
					Face near-endless waves of rubbish in your quest to restore our environment! Collect and research the plastic polluting our water ways to discover and stop their sources before it can join the Kraken. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The more pollution you collect, the less the Trash Kraken can use to grow and take over the world. Use the collected rubbish to research where they come from and how to safely get rid of it.
				</p>

				<img class="ifc" src="images/01_GP_Score.jpg" style="max-width:80%">
				<p>
					(Ignore the "t", I meant to put tonnes but that isn't the right abbreviation...)
				</p>
				<p>
					The goal is to collect more pollution than the Trash Kraken, preventing it from hoarding it for power. This could be represented by the weight/volume of trash collected and/or the types of pollution collected.
				</p>
				<p>
					The gameplay itself would involve tapping/clicking on pieces of rubbish as they rapidly move across the screen. If the player doesn’t collect pieces in time, the Trash Kraken will get them instead. The player needs to collect more than the Kraken to complete each level. These levels would thematically correspond to the various ways plastics pollution ends up in the ocean.
				</p>

				<img class="iwf" src="images/01_GP_Wind.jpg">
				<p>
					One way plastic ends up in the ocean is via the wind. Plastics sitting in landfill and litter in the environment can be blown into waterways, sewage/waste water, and directly into the ocean. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The floaty quality of the wind would make this level a bit easier to play, but the volume of rubbish would make up for that. The challenge is in getting <i>all</i> of the rubbish because just like litter in real life, it can be difficult to prevent all of it from ending up in the environment.
				</p>


				<img class="ifc" src="images/01_GP_Ships.jpg">
				<p>
					A significant proportion of pollution in the ocean comes from maritime transport. Some of the cargo, particularly tiny items in large volumes like plastic pellets, leak into the ocean. Similarly, gear used on boats including fishing equipment can end up overboard, contributing to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The role of freight and industry are often under considered in comparison to consumer waste. It is easy to focus solely on personal responsibility with litter and consumer products. This level would highlight the impact of global shipping and manufacturing.
				</p>


				<img class="ifc" src="images/01_GP_WasteWater.jpg">
				<p>
					Similar to the wind level, this waste water themed level draws attention to a more indirect route that plastic takes. Larger pieces of plastic get washed into drains where they make their way into the ocean. A lot of consumer goods also contribute to the pollution problem when they get washed down our drains at home. Many items, particularly toiletries like wet wipes and cotton buds, are not intended to be flushed. Various bath and body products, toothpaste, cosmetics, etc. also contain microplastics in the form of microbeads.
				</p>


				<img class="ifc" src="images/01_GP_Lab.jpg">
				<p>
					Outside of the gameplay, the player would be able to learn about the types and sources of pollution from the Alien Professor. Once the player has collected enough of each, the Professor will use their Extremely Advanced™ alien technology to research where it comes from, what damage it causes, and how it can be reduced. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Unlocking each type of pollution gives a sense of achievement that encourages the player to continue playing and thus learning more about it.

				<h2>
					Extras
				</h2>
				<p>
					Originally, I had thought about 3D art and gameplay and experimented with a few mockups in <a href="https://ephtracy.github.io/">MagicaVoxel</a>. This could still theoretically become the art style for the game, but I didn’t have time to make any more mockups in this style as it can be quite time consuming.
